# self-watering-plant
A prototype of a self-watering plant system. Water pump communicates with soil moisture sensor, to determine the appropriate times to water the plant. Additionally, a simple water level sensor determines whether water reserves are high, medium or low. 

# Goals
Render plants more autonomous. Rather than remembering to water plants everyday, owners can let the plant water itself when it needs it - receiving text reminders when they need to refill the plant's water reservoir (at a much lower frequency than daily watering).

# Parts list

# Current phase
Prototype. Pump successfully responsive to low soil moistures. Water levels accurately detected. Design still bulky.

# Future goals 
- Miniaturize the system, and develop aesthetic casing.
   ~ Develop casing to contain water reservoirs and pump. 
   ~ Develop or obtain smaller pump, include method to route wires from sensor: bottom of the pot?	
- Connect to wireless (GSM/wifi) and develop partner app
	~ Build texting capabilities to alert owner when water reserves are low
	~ Keep track of missed and successful waterings (due to successful or unsuccessful fillings of the reserve by owner).
